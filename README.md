# Prediction-Using-Ensemble-Techniques
This module introduces Ensemble Learning, focusing on Bagging and Boosting techniques.Compare a single Decision Tree with BaggingClassifier and AdaBoostClassifier using a real dataset. They learn how ensembles reduce bias and variance, improve accuracy, and provide more robust predictions through model combination and performance evaluation.
